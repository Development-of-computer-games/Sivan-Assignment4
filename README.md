# Sivan-Assignment4

### I chose to execute number 6 : creating the world to be "round" , if a player moves to the edge of the map, for example the right side, the player will appear in the left side accordingly, if the player moves to the upper boundry (the ceilling) , they will appear in the opposite side - the floor, with the exact same coordinate.
### The changes that i've made - I created 4 "box collider 2D", for each of them i gave the right coordinate to appear on the screen, Top wall, Down wall, Left wall and right wall.

### In order to catch the collision, I wrote in the player script under the "OnTriggerEnter2D" what to do when each of the collision is made.
